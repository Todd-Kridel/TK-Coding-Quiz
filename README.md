# Bootcamp Module 4 Challenge Assignment -- an Online Coding Quiz application

## Description

This current Module 4 Challenge assignment provided a good mechanism for learning more-advanced JavaScript programming. A large portion and effort of my personal assignment was for a significant attempt to consider about and address concerns of design/content reverse engineering...and of data structuring for various functions and processes...and of commenting about my code for understanding about its purpose. This application-type system was more of a beneficial learning experience...a real-world occupational one...because it was a more-comprehensive purposeful/useable system. The more-user-purpose nature of the assignment required a more-complex effort of considering about and designing and implementing process algorithms and functional layouts of code.

The assignment was also a good mechanism for examining and analyzing and understanding and then designing the external-file Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) -- design appearance -- code and the HTML code of the webpage application that had to be linked to the associated JavaScript code. This assignment provided some additional attention to the concepts/objectives of "Responsiveness".

----

The objectives -- user story and acceptance criteria items -- of the assignment were as follows:

[ User Story ]

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

[ Acceptance Criteria ]

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz...

WHEN I click the start button...
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
WHEN I answer a question...
THEN I am presented with another question.
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly...
THEN time is subtracted from the clock.
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0...
THEN the game is over.
WHEN the game is over...
THEN I can save my initials and score.

[ Additional Grading Criteria ]

Also good coding practices and good GitHub/Git repository configuration.
